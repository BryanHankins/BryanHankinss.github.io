            <p class="about-p"> What drives is to make my own place in this world. A drive to push my self to my limits everyday. A drive to have something to call my own.
                During this pandemic.  I have been  trying to study html/css/ javascript and more at least 2 hours each day . To finnaly put down the curse That has been cursing my family for generations.
                I want to be the first in my family to break out of the retail/factory hole.

        <p class="about-p"> 
            My attitube can be summed up in three words  "Nobody is perfect" . Everyone can still learn . Like how You dont't reallt touch css . When You learn about Scss . Or with the classical border type or learning about new unique things that you can learn with your favorite coding lanuage of choise
            We all can learn from each other from people with differnt mindsets than your own.

        <div class="section-title-1">What I do in freetime?</div>
        <p class="about-p"> What I like to do while not studying is that I like to feed ducks and go walking. 
            I find the experance truly realaxing. I have been feeding them for so long that they reconize my voice and eat from my hand . Most of my many idea's come from a sesson of just realxing at the park and just thinking.
